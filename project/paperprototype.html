            The paper prototype exercise was one of the most steps in building my project. It was interesting to see how my ideas looked on paper and how other people interacted with it. The first round of prototyping showed that some of my user flow did not work with other users, and users didn’t feel comfortable using the application as they didn’t get enough information in the beginning. Through reiteration, I resolved the problem, and the second round of prototyping got a much positive feedback, and I got a couple of ideas to blend some pages to make the process shorter. My second user flow was much stronger and could work for my final project with more fidelity, and content.
