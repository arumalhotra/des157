  <h1>Topic Brainstorm</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Media art, landscape and heritage</h2>
  <p>With the increase in social media especially Facebook, artists have lost their recognition due to excessive sharing/uploading of videos. I want to create a solution that would help this problem for upcoming artists and designers.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Design, Art, Science, and Technology</h2>
  <p>Mental health amongst college students are often disregarded because of our age. But in my opinion, itâ€™s actually much more important because we are exposed so many different things, and a lot of pressure to perform in college. There are a number or resources on campus and I want to create a platform that connects students to these resources.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Interdisciplinary platforms for coexistence</h2>
  <p>There is a lot of technology out there that could be helpful to people with mental or physical disorders if they are catered the right way. I want to possibly build a platform that could support daily functions of life for that demographic.</p>
