    Mental health amongst college students are often disregarded because of our age. But in my opinion, itâ€™s actually much more important because we are exposed so many different things, and a lot of pressure to perform in college. There are a number or resources on campus and I want to create a platform that connects students to these resources.

    Partner: I would like to work with a partner but I haven't had the opportunity to talk to people if they are iterested in similar topics. So if anyone is interested in a similar topic, please let me know!
