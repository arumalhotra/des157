  <h1>Audience Test Results</h1>

  <p>The test results were interesting. The first user gave critical feedback on the project, itâ€™s flow and what she thought of the design. The second user was more focused on the UI of the application rather than the functionality. Both the tests brought out some features that were missing from the application, and some great ideas on how I can improve the prototype. </p>
  <p>For the Final iteration, I will try to figure out Firebase to eliminate the problem of uploading the code. Also, the UI currently makes the website look very medical, and not user friendly for people to trust it. Hence, I will work on that as well.</p>
