            <p>
                I was going with a simple approach, and interaction. The bag moves to indicate that it needs to be clicked on, and every other element has an opacity change to indicate they need to be clicked on. There is a lighting box, which can be closed based on
                users command.
            </p>
            <p>Three aspects of my solution that are effective -</p>
            <ol>
                <li>There is some form of motion to indicate that the image needs to be clicked on, giving users direction.</li>
                <li>There is a hierarchy of arrangements of elements in my design.</li>
                <li>Simplistic approach, makes the interface more attractive instead of leaving the user overwhelmed with information.</li>
            </ol>

                I use LinkedIn the most apart from Facebook. LinkedIn is a professional platform where you can share your professional profile with recruiters and friends. I personally think LinkedIn is a one stop shop for anybody trying to find a job or starting a business.
                It uses a very simple logic yet it is so effective in results!
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike most websites today, each page in LinkedIn has it’s own purpose and you aren’t bombarded with a lot of information at one go. The color scheme is effective, and justified for it’s purpose. The typography is consistent, and professional. There is
                a clear hierarchy of function through the website. The simplicity, and effective design choices of this website, make it the most visited website on my desktop!

        <h2>Blog Post 1</h2>

                Snapchat is one of the applications I use on a daily basis. I personally have a love and hate relationship with the interface. One of the key criterias that I judge an application on is whether or not I use the help section, and how much do I rely on
                the help section or google to use the application. The more support I need to use, the less effective is the interface. With Snapchat’s older version, the tasks of sending snapchat was minimal. You had the text, filter, and emojis all
                on one screen. Even with viewing other user’s snapchat, the tasks was pretty much as simple as clicking on their stories or personal Snapchat.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the newer version of Snapchat has a lot more going on. You can video chat, text chat, view multiple stories at one time, and even keep up with news. For me, this is a lot to expect out of one application. Even though snapchat does a relatively decent
                job in maintaining multiple functions, the iconography, and complexity of tasks makes this application less successful for me. I personally find the news section of this application the least effective, as the purpose of this application
                is to help you keep up with your friends, and not with the world. It increases the effectiveness of this application. Overall, this application is a very creative idea, and hence immensely popular!
