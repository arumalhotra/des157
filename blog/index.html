    	<h3>Chapter 6: Street Signs and Breadcrumbs</h3>
    	<div>
    		<p>
    		Krug opens up Chapter 6 by comparing visiting a website to look for some particular information to being sent to a store to find a specific object. Some people go to a store and ask an employee to help them find something, and others use wayfinding cues to browse through the store. User behaviors, like seeking help or browsing, and the conventions used to help people navigate large department or grocery stores, such as aisle labels and hanging product lists, are similar to user behaviors and best practices of good website design. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
			Krug identifies several navigation conventions that are considered standard among contemporary website design. A major best practice in good navigation to frame the website using a section called the primary navigation. The primary navigation typically includes the following: a Site ID, Sections, Utilities, Search. The Site ID includes a logo or wordmark and serves to help the user quickly identify which website they are on. The Sections of the website are usually presented as a list of links in the primary navigation, similar to aisle signs in a grocery stores, which helps users who are browsing for content narrow down their options. The Search provides an alternative to browsing, and caters to users who have entered the website knowing what they are looking for. The Utilities include other important user interactions, such as a Sign-In or Shopping Cart. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Breadcrumbs are a type of secondary navigation that helps users identify their location in the website. Some of the best strategies while using breadcrumbs is to have them at the top of the page, use “>” between levels and bold the last item. It helps users trace back their path to the original landing point. It is a very useful design strategy to organize data especially in websites like amazon.com or homedepot, which are heavy in content.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The author discusses his admiration for tabs in chapter 6. He finds them self-evident, hard to miss and slick. However, we consider tabs are not the best strategy that works with contemporary website design guidelines. They serve to unsystematic, and often distract the users from their task. They also make the website look dense in design, which could be avoided by using process bars and breadcrumbs. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Good website navigation typically incorporates conventions such as primary navigation and breadcrumbs. Not all of these best practices need to be followed to an exact standard – good navigation is based on the individual needs of a particular website. According to Krug’s “Trunk Test,” website navigation is good when a user is able to understand both the local and global navigational structure in the least amount of time possible.

            The project was aimed to create a chat system using Socket.io and Node.js. There are a couple of ways to use socket.io to make chat function, and I did a lot of research, and tried my best to understand the code as much as I could. This was my first time using a library!!
          </p>
          <p>
            ocket.io is a real time library is a real time library for node.js. Some of its features are that multiple users can join a chat room with unique usernames. It’s almost like a chat room, and a notification can be sent to the users about the chat. It is a very useful library, and there are a lot of resources for anyone who needs to make a chat function.

              The studio works through the concept of 40 years of wedding dresses. As you click through the buttons for different dates, music would play, and also an image would pop up of a wedding corresponding to that decade. The whole website has a very dreamy vibe and seems like a wedding website.

          <p>Three aspects of my solution that are effective -</p>
          <ol>
              <li>User’s would know they have to interact with the buttons as the buttons have a shadow in hover.</li>
              <li>Both music and pictures play at the same time, which gathers the user’s attention.</li>
              <li>There is a hierarchy of events through the website which focuses the user’s attention to one specific section of the website at a time.</li>
          </ol>

                I was going with a simple approach, and interaction. The bag moves to indicate that it needs to be clicked on, and every other element has an opacity change to indicate they need to be clicked on. There is a lighting box, which can be closed based on
                users command.

                <li>There is some form of motion to indicate that the image needs to be clicked on, giving users direction.</li>
                <li>There is a hierarchy of arrangements of elements in my design.</li>
                <li>Simplistic approach, makes the interface more attractive instead of leaving the user overwhelmed with information.</li>

                I use LinkedIn the most apart from Facebook. LinkedIn is a professional platform where you can share your professional profile with recruiters and friends. I personally think LinkedIn is a one stop shop for anybody trying to find a job or starting a business.
                It uses a very simple logic yet it is so effective in results!
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike most websites today, each page in LinkedIn has it’s own purpose and you aren’t bombarded with a lot of information at one go. The color scheme is effective, and justified for it’s purpose. The typography is consistent, and professional. There is
                a clear hierarchy of function through the website. The simplicity, and effective design choices of this website, make it the most visited website on my desktop!

        <h2>Blog Post 1</h2>

            <p>
                Snapchat is one of the applications I use on a daily basis. I personally have a love and hate relationship with the interface. One of the key criterias that I judge an application on is whether or not I use the help section, and how much do I rely on
                the help section or google to use the application. The more support I need to use, the less effective is the interface. With Snapchat’s older version, the tasks of sending snapchat was minimal. You had the text, filter, and emojis all
                on one screen. Even with viewing other user’s snapchat, the tasks was pretty much as simple as clicking on their stories or personal Snapchat.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the newer version of Snapchat has a lot more going on. You can video chat, text chat, view multiple stories at one time, and even keep up with news. For me, this is a lot to expect out of one application. Even though snapchat does a relatively decent
                job in maintaining multiple functions, the iconography, and complexity of tasks makes this application less successful for me. I personally find the news section of this application the least effective, as the purpose of this application
                is to help you keep up with your friends, and not with the world. It increases the effectiveness of this application. Overall, this application is a very creative idea, and hence immensely popular!
