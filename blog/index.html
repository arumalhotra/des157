          Snapchat is one of the applications I use on a daily basis. I personally have a love and hate relationship with the interface. One of the key criterias that I judge an application on is whether or not I use the help section, and how much do I rely on the help section or google to use the application. The more support I need to use, the less effective is the interface. With Snapchat’s older version, the tasks of sending snapchat was minimal. You had the text, filter, and emojis all on one screen. Even with viewing other user’s snapchat, the tasks was pretty much as simple as clicking on their stories or personal Snapchat.

          But the newer version of Snapchat has a lot more going on. You can video chat, text chat, view multiple stories at one time, and even keep up with news. For me, this is a lot to expect out of one application. Even though snapchat does a relatively decent job in maintaining multiple functions, the iconography, and complexity of tasks makes this application less successful for me. I personally find the news section of this application the least effective, as the purpose of this application is to help you keep up with your friends, and not with the world. It increases the effectiveness of this application. Overall, this application is a very creative idea, and hence immensely popular!
